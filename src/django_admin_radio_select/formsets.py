    more than one non-deleted form having any of ``field_names`` set to
    ``True``.

    Works the same for an inline's formset and for a ``ModelAdmin``
    changelist's ``list_editable`` formset — both are ``BaseModelFormSet``
    subclasses. This is the server-side backstop for the client-side
    radio behavior: JS keeps at most one row checked interactively, but a
    handcrafted POST could still submit several. The check runs *after*
    ``formset_class``'s own ``clean()`` (via ``super()``), so whatever
    validation a user-supplied ``InlineModelAdmin.formset`` (or
    ``ModelAdmin.get_changelist_formset``) already does keeps running
    unchanged; this only adds to it.
