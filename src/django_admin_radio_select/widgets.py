    ``type="radio"`` instead of ``type="checkbox"``.

    ``CheckboxInput`` already POSTs exactly the way a radio-per-row needs
    to: present in the data means checked, absent means unchecked/False.
    Only ``input_type`` changes here, which is all Django's widget
    templates key off of for the rendered ``type`` attribute — so a
    ``BooleanField`` using this widget round-trips through a normal
    Django form/formset completely unchanged; only the rendered control
    (and therefore its default browser styling and grouping semantics)
    is different.

    ``media`` lives here rather than on the admin mixin on purpose: a
    widget only exists once a field is actually radioized, and only ever
    gets *rendered* as part of the specific form/formset that uses it —
    Django aggregates a rendered page's media from exactly the
    forms/widgets it renders. So this script only ever loads on a
    changelist that actually has a ``list_editable`` radio column, or a
    change view that actually has a radioized inline — never anywhere
    else — with no extra request- or view-awareness needed here. An
    admin-level ``media`` property couldn't do this: Django computes
    ``ModelAdmin.media``/``InlineModelAdmin.media`` the same way
    regardless of which view asked for it, so it can't tell "changelist"
    from "change form" apart.
