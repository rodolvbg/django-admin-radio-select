class RadioSelectMixin(BaseModelAdmin):
    """Mixin for ``ModelAdmin``, ``TabularInline``, or ``StackedInline``
    that renders the ``BooleanField``\\ s named in
    ``radio_select_exclusive_fields`` as radio buttons, synchronized
    client-side so selecting one clears the others in the same column —
    while every row keeps its own Django-generated field name, so the
    formset POST is completely unaffected.

    - On an inline, this applies to every row of that inline's formset.
    - On a ``ModelAdmin``, it applies to the changelist's
      ``list_editable`` formset — the field must be in both
      ``list_display`` and ``list_editable`` for Django to render it as
      an editable column at all; ``radio_select_exclusive_fields`` only
      controls how that column renders and is validated, same as inline.

    Meant to sit before ``admin.ModelAdmin``/``admin.TabularInline``/
    ``admin.StackedInline`` in a subclass's bases, e.g.
    ``class ImageInline(RadioSelectMixin, admin.TabularInline)``.
    Inheriting from ``BaseModelAdmin`` — the common base of both
    ``ModelAdmin`` and ``InlineModelAdmin`` — rather than staying a bare
    mixin gives ``self``/``super()`` their real types for free; the
    ``# type: ignore[misc]`` on each ``super()`` call below is only
    because ``BaseModelAdmin`` itself doesn't declare ``get_formset``/
    ``get_changelist_formset`` (only the concrete ``InlineModelAdmin``/
    ``ModelAdmin`` a using class also inherits from do), so a type
    checker can't confirm they'll exist until the two are combined.

    See ``RadioCheckboxInput.media`` for how the JS gets loaded — not
    from a ``media`` property here, since ``ModelAdmin.media`` /
    ``InlineModelAdmin.media`` are computed the same way no matter which
    view is asking, so a property here couldn't tell a changelist render
    apart from a change-form render.
